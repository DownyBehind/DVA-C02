# AWS Elastic Beamstalk

## OverView

Developer problems on AWS

- Managing infrastructure
- Deploying Code
- Configuring all the databases, load balancers, etc
- Scaling concerns

- Most web apps have the same architecture (ALB + ASG)
- All the develoers want is for their code to run!
- Possibly, consistently across different applications and environments

- Elastic Beanstalk is a developer centric view of deploying an application on AWS
- It uses all the component's we've seen before: EC2, ASG, ELB, RDS,...
- Managed service
: Automatically handles capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling, application health monitoring, instance configuration,...
